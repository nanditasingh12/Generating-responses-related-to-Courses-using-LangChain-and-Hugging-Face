# Generating-responses-related-to-Courses-using-LangChain-and-Hugging-Face
 Gen AI Project Using LangChain &amp; Hugging Face
 We are building a Q&A system for an e-learning company who have thousands of learners who uses discord server or email to ask questions. This system will help students where they can ask questions and get answers.

Project Highlights
Use a real CSV file of FAQs or or any other platform like coursera.
Their human staff will use this file to assist thetir course learners.
We will build an LLM based question and answer system that can reduce the workload of their human staff.
Students should be able to use this system to ask questions directly and get answers within seconds.

Things I have learned here:
Langchain + Google Palm: LLM based Q&A
Huggingface instructor embeddings: Text embeddings
FAISS: Vector databse

Steps to follow:
Step 1: Create a Folder
Create a folder to organize your project files. Name it appropriately (e.g., HuggingFace_Project).
Place your dataset file, sample.csv, in this folder.


Hereâ€™s a step-by-step outline for your project based on your instructions. This workflow ensures clarity and structure while working on your dataset and integrating Hugging Face for generating responses to questions:

Step 1: Create a Folder
Create a folder to organize your project files. Name it appropriately (e.g., HuggingFace_Project).
Place your dataset file, sample.csv, in this folder.

Step 2: Open the Folder in Terminal or Notebook
Navigate to the folder via Terminal or open it in Jupyter Notebook.

Step 3: Import Required Libraries
Open a new Python script or Jupyter Notebook and start importing necessary libraries:

Step 4: Convert your dataset into vector embeddings the final output will look like this:

Step 5: Set Up Hugging Face Pipeline
Initialize the Hugging Face model and FAISS for answering questions. For example, use a Question-Answering pipeline:

Step 6: This is the final output that we will get:
